									<h1>My Background</h1>
									<div class="image main"><img src="images/Face Shot (2).jpg" alt="" /></div>
									<p>Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Jomel Capili, a versatile individual with a passion for gathering, transforming, and organizing data to drive informed and profitable decisions. With a strong background in data analysis and proficiency in various analytical platforms, including SQL, spreadsheets, Power BI, and Tableau, I possess the skills necessary to extract valuable insights and present them effectively.<br />
										<br />
										Throughout my journey, I completed the rigorous Google Data Analytics Certificate program, further enhancing my expertise in analytics. I also hold technical knowledge in software such as Tableau, Power BI, RapidMiner, MySQL, and SPSS. Programming languages such as SQL, Java, Python, and R are part of my toolkit, enabling me to leverage their capabilities for complex data analysis.<br />
										<br />
										Having earned a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, Information Systems, from the University of Nevada Las Vegas, I have a solid academic foundation in relevant coursework, including Database Design and Implementation, Advanced Business Analytics, Big Data Analytics in Business, and Quantitative Analysis. My dedication to academic excellence is reflected in my inclusion on the Dean's Honor List for Spring 2020 and Spring 2021, alongside being a recipient of the Nevada Millennium Scholarship. <br />
										<br />
										In addition to my educational background, I have actively pursued professional certifications, including the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and SQL for Data Science from UC Davis. These certifications validate my expertise in utilizing data analysis techniques to drive meaningful insights and support decision-making processes.<br />
										<br />
										Throughout my career, I have also showcased my abilities through various projects. One notable example is the Database Design and Implementation project, where I successfully created, analyzed, and designed a database system using MySQL. By addressing a business problem, I demonstrated the value that effective database management can provide. The project involved the creation of a comprehensive entity-relationship and logical schema design, as well as the development of SQL queries to generate reports for decision-making purposes.<br />
										<br />
										Prior to my data-driven journey, I worked as a Freelance Photographer and Photo Editor. This experience allowed me to capture high-quality images of special events, groups, and individuals, while utilizing Adobe software like Lightroom and Photoshop for post-image enhancements. With a keen eye for detail and a commitment to client satisfaction, I honed my interpersonal skills and developed a knack for delivering innovative and energetic visual stories.<br />
										<br />
										As you explore my portfolio, you'll discover my proficiency in data analysis, data visualization, and data-driven decision-making. Through effective presentations and a deep understanding of analytics tools, I strive to make a significant impact in any organization I collaborate with.<br />
										<br />
										Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to discussing how my skills and experiences can contribute to your data-driven initiatives. Feel free to reach out to me at jomelcapili@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn at www.linkedin.com/in/jomelcapili.
